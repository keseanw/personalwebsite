  - My journey as a Mobile Developer has led me to a focus in Android development. After graduating from NJIT, I decided to start a travel business while also working full-time for my current employer. While working on the travel business, I wore many hats but the one that I enjoyed the most was Android development. The passion and interest I have for Android has given me the opportunity to join a mobile development team within my current job. I have been fortunate to get enterprise level experience writing Android apps that bring value to thousands of users. The most beautiful aspect of Android development is the active open source community and the constant evolution on the platform. It truly feeds my curiosity and hunger for growth - while keeping me on my toes!

  - I love to explore. I've lived in Hong Kong for a few months and also traveled to numerous countries. I've been learning Mandarin for a few years. I love writing software. I might watch "The Office" entirely too much. I also enjoy a good movie.

  - Feel free to reach out to me! I’d like to think I’m a pretty open person and I’d love to get to know others who are in my field or not. Apart from my current focuses, I have a wide array of interests and I don’t mind learning of a new one as well. If you’re interested in talking more about my work experience, you can reach me via the contact form below and the links at the bottom of the page. I’m also open to new opportunities. Cheers!
